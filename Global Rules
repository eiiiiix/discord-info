General Rules
1. Donâ€™t be sexist, racist, anti-semitic or *phobic and don't dox people on this server.
4. Don't impersonate anyone, even if they're outside this chat. However, you can as a joke as long as you make it obvious you're not them. Never impersonate a banned member, if a staff member thinks they won't appreciate it.
7. Report your alt accounts to staff. Staff will give them the appropiate roles.
8. Donâ€™t harass users on this server.
10. If staff wishes to kick or ban you, they can do so if they have a valid reason.
11. Selfbots are permitted, please don't spam commands as they'll mess with logging methods. Using them sparingly is fine.
